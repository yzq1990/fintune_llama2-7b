The prompt spreads in the U.S. benchmark, WTI Crude, are already in contango, signaling enough near-term supply. Brent Crude front-month to second-month futures prices also dipped into contango earlier this week. Contango is the state of the market in which prices for delivery at later dates are higher than prompt prices—a market situation signaling oversupply and one which traders use to store oil for delivery at a later date. The opposite market situation—backwardation—typically occurs at times of market deficit and in it, prices for front-month contracts are higher than the ones further out in time. Another oil market metric closely followed for signs of demand in the key oil-importing region, Asia, is the premium of Oman futures over Dubai swaps. That premium dropped on Thursday to below $1 per barr', \"Chevron received an expanded U.S. license allowing it to resume production in Venezuela and to import the South American country's crude into the United States.\", 'The US has granted Chevron limited authorization to resume pumping oil from Venezuela following the announcement Saturday that the Venezuelan government and the opposition group have reached an agreement on humanitarian relief and will continue to negotiate for a solution to the country’s chronic economic and political crisis, including a focus on the 2024 elections. A senior Biden administration official described Saturday’s announcements as “important steps in the right direction,” but noted that there is still much to be done as both parties work toward a more permanent solution to the ongoing crisis. The official also highlighted the license’s limited nature saying that they do not expect this to have a tangible impact on international oil prices and that the move is intended as an inducement for the negotiations – not a reaction to high global oil prices.

This has forced refiners to exercise caution in order to stay afloat. It has also resulted in a loss of U.S. refining capacity. One of the under-reported factors behind the ongoing diesel shortage is the loss of U.S. refining capacity since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Today I will discuss the factors that led to this loss. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), at the beginning of the pandemic U.S. refiners had 19.0 million barrels per day (BPD) of operable refining capacity (Source). This was the highest number ever reported by the EIA. By December 2021, that number had fallen to 17.9 million BPD — a loss of 1.1 million BPD of capacity in less than two years.

When mortgage rates are rising, purchasing a home becomes more expensive, and selling a home becomes more difficult due to decreased home affordability.

New statistics released indicate our national emergency oil stockpile, which is intended to protect the United States from unexpected and severe supply disruptions, has hit another historic low. It’s a dangerous point for the United States, and even worse, it’s self-inflicted. With these facts in mind, new reports indicate the Biden administration plans to sell oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an attempt to assuage fuel prices, which was on the forefront of the mind of voters in last week’s midterm elections. According to new data released from the Energy Information Administration, our oil reserves stockpile is down to just 396 million barrels.

Sales of existing homes – which include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops – were down 28.4% in October from a year ago and down 5.9% from September, according to the National Association of Realtors. All regions of the US saw month-over-month and year-over-year declines. That continues a slowing trend that began in February and marks the longest streak of declining sales on record. Sales in October were at their weakest level since May 2020, when the real estate market was at a standstill during the pandemic lockdowns. Beyond that, sales last month were the weakest they have been since December 2011. How much house can I afford? Still, home prices continued to climb during the month.

Ionic liquids (ILs) can be used as new alternatives in comparison to water and organic solvents due to their considerable properties to elevate the stability and resistance of the AuNPs against aggregation for a long period of storage. In this study, we employ molecular dynamics simulation and quantum chemistry calculations to investigate the effects of amino acid ILs ([BMIM][Gly], [BMIM][Leu], [BMIM][Pro], [BMIM][Val], and [BMIM][Ala]) on the stability and aggregation process of the AuNPs from the molecular viewpoint. Our results suggest that ILs can prevent AuNP aggregation. These ILs penetrate the solvation shell of the nanoparticles and by increasing the electrostatic repulsions on the surface of the AuNPs improve their stability against aggregation. Moreover, the [BMIM]+ cation is more effective on the stability of the AuNPs in comparison with the corresponding anions. The ring of the cation, due to the stronger interaction with the AuNPs compared to the side chain, contributes predominantly to the stability of the nanostructures. Our quantum chemistry calculations confirm that dispersion interactions between the cation and anions of the ILs and the surface of gold play a key role in the stability of the IL–AuNP complexes. [Leu]− anion has the strongest dispersion interactions with the metal surface and forms the most stable complex with the AuNPs. Overall, the results of this study offer new insights into the properties of amino acid ILs as effective agents to improve the stability of AuNPs for long-term storage.', 'The rising rate of road deaths in the US continues to defy global trends.

Although effective vaccines have long existed, current vaccines take both time and cost to produce. Messenger RNA (mRNA) technology is an emergent vaccine platform that supports rapid vaccine development on a large scale. Here, an optimized mRNA vaccine construct (LVRNA001) expressing rabies virus glycoprotein (RABV-G) was developed in vitro and then evaluated in vivo for its immunogenicity and protective capacity in mice and dogs. LVRNA001 induced neutralizing antibody production and a strong Th1 cellular immune response in mice. In both mice and dogs, LVRNA001 provided protection against challenge with 50-fold lethal dose 50 (LD50) of RABV. With regards to protective efficiency, an extended dosing interval (14 days) induced greater antibody production than 3- or 7-day intervals in mice. Finally, post-exposure immunization against RABV was performed to evaluate the survival rates of dogs receiving two 25 μg doses of LVRNA001 vs. five doses of inactivated vaccine over the course of three months. Survival rate in the LVRNA001 group was 100%, whereas survival rate in the inactivated vaccine control group was only 33.33%. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that LVRNA001 induced strong protective immune responses in mice and dogs, which provides a new and promising prophylactic strategy for rabies.', 'Oil prices jumped $5 to a record high above $147 a barrel on Friday amid growing worries about threats to supplies from Iran and Nigeria and a strike by Brazilian oil workers next week.', 'MarineTraffic Live Ships Map.

On Wednesday, Amrita Sen, co-founder and research director at consultants Energy Aspects, said on Bloomberg TV that the market risks losing Russian barrels in December as EU restrictions on imports and shipping potentially dissuade tanker owners from moving that country’s crude. As a result, oil prices “are going to be headed well over $100” going into December while near-term prices are pressured by strikes in France and lockdowns in China that suppress demand.

Appearing on CNN, Hochstein proclaimed “I think we have been clear that we want to see the U.S. industry increase oil production.” Then in the same breath, Hochstein stated that the main goal is to limit production of fossil fuel derived energy now in order to “make sure that we’re in a better footing to accelerate the transition.” “So, we have to make that differentiation to make sure that the American consumer has what it needs… to grow our economy and the global economy, but not take steps and endanger the climate work that we’re trying to do,” Hochstein further declared.

But the good news for drivers — and Biden — is that several factors are pointing to lower prices ahead at the pump. The national average stood at $3.85 a gallon Wednesday, down 2 cents from Tuesday and 7 cents in the last week. Much of that decline was driven by a steep price drop in western states, where prices had shot up to near record levels earlier this month. One of the biggest factors in the recent price surge has been US refineries shutting down either for regular maintenance or following accidents — such as an explosion at a refinery near Toledo, Ohio, last month. But a number of West Coast refineries that had been offline have returned to operations, and that has sparked a plunge in gas prices west of the Rocky Mountains, driving down the national average.

The national average price Monday was $3.92 for a gallon of regular gas. That’s up 12 cents in just the last week and 24 cents since a 98-day price slide ended late last month. Part of that spike followed last week’s decision by OPEC+ to cut production by 2 million barrels a day in an effort to lift prices.

Ukrainian forces inflicted another significant operational defeat on Russia and liberated Lyman, Donetsk Oblast, on October 1. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) announced the withdrawal of Russian troops from Lyman to “more advantageous positions” to avoid the “threat of encirclement” in the settlement.[1] Social media footage and Ukrainian military officials confirmed that Ukrainian forces have entered Lyman and are likely clearing the settlement as of October 1.

It’s time for our eighth general report (if you look at it sideways, it’ll be our Infinity-eth)! We know you guys have been waiting for this one, so let’s jump straight into it. As you all know, CHAOS;HEAD NOAH has been banned from Steam. This is incredibly unfortunate, and even downright unfair. Valve’s review process has repeatedly been shown to not judge Visual Novels properly—to the point of obvious bias. It’s very sad to us that this has affected the first entry in such a beloved series. (For those who are wondering what happened and would like to know more, this article by Ars Technica summarizes the situation excellently.) Speaking not as patchers, but as fans, we heavily condemn this decision by Valve. We can’t help but think, “Is there anything we can do about this?” And we’ve come to the conclusion that yes, there is. Considering our team is spread out across the globe, we can’t exactly go marching down to Valve HQ.

The bill cleared the Senate on a 72-25 vote Thursday and the House on a 230-201 vote Friday.

Brian Kemp. The lawsuit - filed nearly four years ago by Abrams\\' PAC, Fair Fight Georgia, sought to change how the state conducts elections. Earlier this year, the judge narrowed the scope of the lawsuit by dismissing many of its original claims. Abrams claimed there was \"misconduct, fraud or irregularities\" in the voting process - a cardinal sin if you\\'re a conservative who similarly questions election integrity. She took legal action to stop counties from throwing out rejected provisional and absentee ballots when updated vote totals made clear that Kemp was the likely winner. \"Although Georgia’s election system is not perfect, the challenged practices violate neither the constitution nor the [Voting Rights Amendment],\" said U.S. District Judge Steven Jones in his ruling.

The assumption was an enduring one for oil and gas both. A number of analysts toured the media, arguing that if production at an oil or gas field is suspended, this field eventually risks becoming unproductive forever. While this is a valid argument overall, Gazprom appears to have found a way to avoid permanent loss of gas production, and it’s not flaring, either. In fact, flaring in Russia—a major “flarer”—is down. This is according to satellite data cited by a Bloomberg report on Gazprom’s production, which has declined substantially since the Ukraine invasion and the EU’s response to it.

There are a number of factors that have weighed on precious metals, but as the World Gold Council points out, it’s important to put gold and silver’s recent price movements in a broader perspective. In fact, gold has been one of the better-performing asset classes in 2022. Gold has outperformed US bonds, foreign bonds, the S&P 500, foreign stocks, the NASDAQ, and US Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). The only things that have outperformed gold are commodities, especially oil and agricultural goods, and the US dollar. So, while gold has fallen more than 5% over the year, it has fallen far less than most other assets, and if you hold gold in your portfolio, it has helped hedge some of those other losses. Dollar strength has been the story of 2022.

Fuel markets worldwide are also tight which, combined with soaring tanker prices, will only add to inflation fears. In the new era of energy shortages, one aspect of the situation has tended to get overlooked: the transport of energy. Demand for tankers has been on the rise since the European Union slapped sanctions on Russia in the spring, and this trend is only going to intensify in the coming months as the EU embargo on Russian oil and fuels enters into effect.
